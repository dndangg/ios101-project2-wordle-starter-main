# Project 2 - *Expanded Wordle*

Submitted by: **Dylan Dang**

**Expanded Wordle** is an app that is an app that allows users to play a stripped-down version of wordle, a multi-round word guessing game that narrows down letters after each round. Built off the simple version in project 1, this version adds more functionalities: the ability to change the numbers of letters per guess, the number of guesses, themed words, and an alien wordle feature.

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can change the number of letters per row (the length of the goal word)
- [x] User can change the numbers of rows on the board (how many guesses allowed)
- [x] User can select a new themed set to pull the goal word from
- [x] User can select "alien wordle", causing the goal word to change after each guess


The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] App displays a reset button on the top left to reset the game (but make no changes to the settings)

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Notes

My main troubles this time came with the video walkthrough. After a lot of failure and fiddling, I came to the conclusion that embedding an imgur upload into GitHub has around a 5 MB limit. Above that, the videos fail to embed.
